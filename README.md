# "Black Death" RAT / Logger

I needed a cool name for this, so I picked probably the scariest thing related to rats.

# What does it do?

- Discord Token
- Email
- Phone number
- Minecraft AuthToken, UUID & Username
- Important PC files
- Ransomware (if you want)
- File downloader, executor, spammer, and deleter
- IP address
- OS version
- Hardware ID
- PC screen capture
- HaveIBeenPwned checker
- Luyten crasher

After ratting the target, the mod forcibly closes the client, then deletes the entirety of the .minecraft folder (including itself), as well as the launcher. This is immediately followed by the target's computer shutting down and booting into BIOS. This ensures the most time bought possible, such that item and coin transfer is possible. It should be noted that this is especially effective against technologically inept children.

# Stealing a session

Go to the **.minecraft** directory and find the **version** folder. Open the **1.8.9 OptiFine** directory, and edit the .json file. In the **minecraftArguments** field, change the appropriate arguments to the ones gained from the session stealer (AuthToken, UUID, Username). Starting minecraft should then log you into their account.

# Transferring stolen items

Basically just pretend to be really good at auction sniping.
