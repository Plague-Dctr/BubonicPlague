# "Black Death" RAT / Logger

# Stealing a session

Go to the **.minecraft** directory and find the **version** folder. Open the **1.8.9 OptiFine** directory, and edit the .json file. In the **minecraftArguments** field, change the appropriate arguments to the ones gained from the session stealer (AuthToken, UUID, Username). Starting minecraft should then log you into their account.

# Transferring stolen items

Basically just pretend to be really good at auction sniping.
